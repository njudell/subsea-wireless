Recommendations for consistent parameter definitions:
- `name`
    - minimum unambiguous description of the parameter, expected to be used as variable names or other machine-readable applications
    - lowercase alphanumeric latin alphabet only
    - words delineated by underscore `_` character for clarity
    - no other punctuation or special characters
    - consistent abbreviations to include:
        - `min` and `max`
        - `comms` and `power` prefix to disambiguate communications and power parameters with similar names
- `description`
    - minimum unambiguous human-readable description of the parameter
    - may contain extended character sets, punctuation etc.
    - consistent with the associated `name`


In 2024-04, parameters defined in the initial spreadsheet were converted to JSON consistent with the schema. This was initially undertaken using the included csv_to_json Python script. After this, a manual conversion process was completed to compare the JSON to the spreadsheet and propose updated names and descriptions to maintain internal consistency. Main changes during this process are noted below:
- Duplicate ID '2' was used for SWIG Version Major and SWIG Type Version Minor. Added manual entry for SWIG Type Version Minor with ID 140
- Renamed 'SWiG type version' to 'SWiG type' to reflect usage
- Updated `lateral_displacement` and `directivity` description and representation
- Renamed some parameters (script had used description) - e.g. manufacturer_unique_identifier
- removed units from name (retained `bytes` descriptor)
- Changed name to use `max` and `min` and description to use `maximum` and `minimum`
- Used `tx` and `rx` in name, and `transmitter` and `receiver` in description
- Added units examples where appropriate (e.g. Voltage(dV) )
- Set available data rates as json (representation to be determined), was int type but may be discrete list rather than just one maximum value?
- Remove capitalisation from name and description where appropriate
- Is 31 local_connection_configuration related to 135 networking_capabilities?
- 41, 42 AGC parameters represented as integer/enum?
- 43 Average noise level represented as uint8, presumed dB above threshold
- 43 average noise level same as 55 background noise?
- 62 removed - blank line
- 65 removed - strike-through Date/Time line, duplicate of other parameter
- 68 to 76 updated data types (script converted as default json where not clear from CSV)
- 75 possible duplicate of 33 comms_tx_power
- 76 possible duplicate of 44 rssi
- 86 to 89 renamed to clarify these are limits set on power transfer parameters
- 82 to 89 changed data type to uint16 to represent voltage/current in likely ranges from default json
- 99 and 100 are unclear, may be commands rather than parameters so move to protocol definition
- 101 and 102 are setter/getter for the same parameter, removed 102
- 105 power status and 107 power control status propose uint8 to represent enumerated status values
- 122 and 123 are setter/getter, removed 123
- 125 to 128 are setters/getters for different parts of capabilities (originally only/specifically for Level 3 acoustics but principle is more widely applicable). Reduced to single JSON that can be used for any tech capabilities
